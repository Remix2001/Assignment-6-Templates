            <p><em>"I wanted a unique daily planner design for school, so I started looking through freelance designers. After seeing his good reviews, I decided to try Wise Choice Design. He responded to my inquiry within 24 hours and after getting some specifications on what I was looking for, created several concept sketches. Once I settled on a design I liked, I had the final planner within a week. He was friendly and professional throughout the entire process, and the prices were very reasonable. Overall, this was an attentive, timely, and budget friendly service.”<br>Jonathan, Fort Collins, CO</em></p>

            <p><em>“We needed an original poster design for our business’s upcoming car show, and we needed it fast. I knew that Wise Choice Design hadn’t been around for too long, but I’d seen several reviews on his quick turnaround time and decided to take a chance. So, I reached out to see if he could make a high-quality poster within our time limits. Not only did he respond quickly, but he had two fully-fledged poster options ready in only two days. Both options looked great, but I managed to settle on one. His price was more than fair, and the entire process was quick and painless. Highly recommend!”<br>RJ, Fort Collins, CO</em></p>
